# Kaggle-French-Employement

This dataset was given to me by a company during the technical interview stage. I was given 5 days to generate useful insights on the dataset given.

### During the span of 5 days, I performed:
1) Data Cleaning - Handling Missing Data, Changing French words to English, Handling Duplicate Data
2) Data Aggregation - Getting Mean Salary of Women and Male Workers 
3) Simple Feature Selection by removing unncesary/redundant features
4) Data Visualization
